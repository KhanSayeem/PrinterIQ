# Operator Runbook

Macauley's guide for day-to-day operations.

## SSH into the VPS

```bash
ssh root@170.64.143.200
cd /root/printeriq
```

## View service status

```bash
pm2 status
```

Healthy output shows three processes (`pipeline`, `reply-agent`, `dashboard`) with status `online`.

## View logs

```bash
pm2 logs pipeline       # Python workers
pm2 logs reply-agent    # Node.js webhook + Claude handler
pm2 logs dashboard      # Next.js dashboard

pm2 logs --lines 100    # All services, last 100 lines
```

## Restart a service

```bash
pm2 restart pipeline
pm2 restart reply-agent
pm2 restart dashboard
pm2 restart all         # restart everything
```

## Restart Nginx

```bash
systemctl reload nginx
```

## Deploy a new release

Deployments trigger automatically when a commit is pushed to `main` via GitHub Actions.
To deploy manually:

```bash
cd /root/printeriq
git pull origin main
pm2 restart all
pm2 save
```

## Apply a new database migration

```bash
# Option A: Supabase dashboard SQL editor (paste the SQL file content)
# Option B: psql (if installed)
psql $DATABASE_URL -f database/migrations/0003_<name>.sql
```

## Ingest a new Apollo CSV

1. Upload the CSV to `/root/printeriq/uploads/` on the VPS
2. Trigger the ingest job (dashboard upload feature or direct queue push):

```bash
cd /root/printeriq/services/pipeline
python -m src.workers.ingest --file /uploads/<filename>.csv
```

Use `--dry-run` first to validate without writing:

```bash
python -m src.workers.ingest --file /uploads/<filename>.csv --dry-run
```

## Check queue health

```bash
redis-cli
> LLEN bull:pipeline:wait    # jobs waiting in pipeline queue
> LLEN bull:replies:wait     # jobs waiting in replies queue
```

## Local smoke testing

Local Redis and orchestrator smoke tests are safe to run while domains and mailboxes are warming up. Start local Redis with:

```powershell
docker start printeriq-redis
```

Then run the orchestrator smoke test:

```bash
python -m src.workers.orchestrator
```

This only checks Redis connectivity, registered workers, concurrency settings, and pending queue count. It does not send emails.

Do not run live `schedule_outreach` smoke tests until warmup is complete and a paused dev/test Instantly campaign ID is configured:

```env
INSTANTLY_CAMPAIGN_ID=<paused_dev_campaign_id>
```

## Monitor escalation SMSes

Escalation SMSes go to `+61 400 457 006`. If you receive one:
1. Open the dashboard `/leads` and find the lead by name/business
2. Read the full conversation thread on `/leads/[id]`
3. Use the "Override reply" action to send a custom response, or call the lead directly

## Check dead-letter queue

Dead-lettered jobs appear in `queue_jobs` table with `status = 'dead'`. Review them in the Supabase dashboard:

```sql
SELECT * FROM queue_jobs WHERE status = 'dead' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;
```
